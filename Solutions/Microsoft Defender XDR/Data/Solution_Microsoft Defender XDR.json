  "Description": "The [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest Security Alerts/Incidents and raw logs from the products within Microsoft Defender XDR suite into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nAdditional Hunting Queries to support proactive and reactive hunting for the Microsoft Defender XDR solution can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/Microsoft%20365%20Defender). This repository has a collection of queries developed by Microsoft Security Research and Microsoft Sentinel community contributions.\n\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**\n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\n\na.
